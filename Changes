Revision history for DateTime-Format-Human-Duration

0.4    Wed Apr 11 21:46:08 CDT 2012
       * Simplified version number scheme to ordinary decimal.
       * Minor POD changes
       * Fixed 02.array.t (hopefully) to actually use nb.pm and to 
         pass when DateTime is not installed.

0.0.3  Tue Apr 10 20:37:18 CDT 2012
       * Updated manifest - 0.0.2 was missing some needed files. Big whoops!

0.0.2  Tue Apr 10 20:08:34 2012
